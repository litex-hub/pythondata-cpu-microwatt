The Xilinx SPI flashing proxies come from here:

https://github.com/quartiq/bscan_spi_bitstreams/blob/single-tap/bscan_spi_xc7a100t.bit?raw=true

These are the "old" single tap versions that are supported by the openocd
release packaged in distros (0.10). If you use the wrong versions you see this:

If you find yourself with a later openocd version that contians 867bdb2e9248
("jtagspi: new protocol that includes transfer length"), such as v0.11 as
packaged by Debian Bullseye, you should use the bitstream from the master
branch:

https://github.com/quartiq/bscan_spi_bitstreams/blob/master/bscan_spi_xc7a35t.bit?raw=true
https://github.com/quartiq/bscan_spi_bitstreams/blob/master/bscan_spi_xc7a100t.bit?raw=true

These are in the microwatt repository as bscan_spi_xc7a*t_openocd_v0.11.bit.
